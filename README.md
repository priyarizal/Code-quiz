Code-quiz

# Description
I built this code quiz from scratch as a part of my UCB coding bootcamp homework. It's a quiz with 4 questions for which users have 60 seconds to complete. Each wrong question takes 10 seconds off the timer. Users will be notified if they pick the right answer or the wrong answer. It's fairly simple. I enjoyed my learning process on this one because I really started to understand the JS. This was also my most challenging project to date.
