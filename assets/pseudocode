pseudocode for the last couple of things I've got left 

//things left to do: find a way to tell it to get the next question and next answer
 this must be a loop

//end the quiz

//insert timer and trigger it to only reduce time when it gets a false answer

//hide rightanswer text or wronganswer text depending on users input

//calculate right answers and corresponding seconds remaining 

//if users want to play again : store seconds remaining
